# Week 3 - Reflection
> Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

- `+=` means increment by one step, as opposed to `next_step = next step + step`; therefore `-=` means reduce by one step [or whatever value].
- Coding `intuition` ... 
- `while` loops:
    ``` while <some kind of condition>
            if:
            elif:
            else:
        return <something>
    ``` 
- `try` + `except` ... 
- Browse the internet for a new `brain`. Preferably one that functions.
    ``` def new_brain(thought, logic, personality)
            <etc>
            return intelligence
    ```
