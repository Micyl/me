# Week 2 - Reflection
> Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

- `f-strings` re: text formatting - cleaner [or easier?] way of text formatting
- Draw diagrams when it gets hard!
- """ Triple quotes = a `docstring`. Explaining what a function does """
- Operators? `and` operator - `not` operator [inversing boolean]
- Returning does not require colons. Just `return "something"`
- Can have multiple `elif` statements until resolved!
- `'int' object is not iterable` ... hence convert to `str` ?? check
- cast values to strings early
- looked at how to slice a list for the final task / looked at the process + methods
- used `if` + `else`statements to operate on specific indexes to get the final exercise working
