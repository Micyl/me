# Week 1 - Reflection
> Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

- Setup my dev environment.
- Linked my git stuff etc - started using the "git push" command to see if they are working.
- I made a Trinket and [wrote my name with a turtle](https://trinket.io/blocks/2360b41cb8).
- Started to learn the GitHub Markdown formatting.
