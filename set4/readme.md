# Week 4 - Reflection
> Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

- `JSON DRLO`
- `range` function can either be reversed, `reversed(range(1, 5, 1))` or just written reversed `range(5, 1, -1)` ... or someshit
- opening/ reading/ writing etc is sketchy AF. Need to revisit/ look into the more robust methods of operating + writing to files. 
- Need to work on methods to `iterate` to extract data from JSON files... potentially better than "deep diving" on individual variables? 
- Need to do constant exercises to keep up chops.
- Chop chop.
